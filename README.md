1. First u have to pull or copy paste the main file that is named as "Complex.java"

2.After that you have to save the file as "Complex.java "

3.   You might think why ? 
   well you can give any name but the main class name should be the same as file name

4.Class Complex is the main Class here, because that is where the main method( public static void main() )is shown
  So in java your main class name and file name must be same 

5.Now Calc is another class I have used to do all the calculation, it's not main Class though

6.All the class file is auto generated (Calc.class , Complex.class).. you don't have to do anything with that

Just copy paste the code from "Complex.java" follow instructions and run
